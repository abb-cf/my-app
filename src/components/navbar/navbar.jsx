import React from 'react';

//make a named function that returns an unordered list (style with bootstrap?)
//with link items (home, profile-view, signup and signout)


//create a method that returns a token from local storage; the else function
//should return false. Use this method to hide the signup page if the 
//token exists and to display home, profile and signout.


//create a method that signs the user out when the signout button is clicked.




//check that this looks like the illustrated example in the exercise
//THEN

//import your named function into main-view.jsx
//place navbar after the router in the main view so it appears on all views
//with the navbar now in place, in main-view.jsx, create the routes for the views
//in your navbar.
//check with illustrated example.
